Passster is the best and simplest solution to password-protect your content.

== Description ==

Protect your entire website, only single pages or posts or just areas of content within it.
Passster brings a lot of flexibility in creating password-protected areas on your website.

**Area protection**

Create protected areas that can be added with a simple shortcode.
The shortcode will be fully generated for you based on your configuration of your area.

**Page protection**

Protect entire pages with the same settings you already know from the area protection, but without even using a shortcode.
It blocks the entire page while keeping your layout intact instead of showing an ugly protection layout.

**Global Protection**

On each page, you can select to activate the global protection. Each visitor without the required password will be redirected to the page
as long as they are not authenticated. The Cookie option from Passster->Options is required for this.

**Pagebuilder**

All three protection modes supporting all well-known page builders.
Currently successfully tested are:

* WPBakery Pagebuilder
* Elementor / Elementor Pro
* Beaver Builder
* Divi Builder
* Oxygen Builder
* Gutenberg

To avoid any layout shifts or rendering problems, it's highly recommended to activate the "Reload after successful validation" option in Passster->Options->Compatibility Mode.


= Features =

**Free**

* restrict areas and add them via shortcode
* restrict pages

Paired with exceptional support directly from the developer, timely updates and feature integrations, and extensive documentation you can't go wrong with Passster Pro.

**Documentation**

I regularly optimize the documentation and release extensive tutorials on how to use Passster in a multitude of use-cases.

Learn more on [patrickposner.dev/docs](https://patrickposner.dev/docs/)

== Support ==

The free support is exclusively limited to the wordpress.org support forum.

Any kind of email priority support, customization, and integration help need a valid premium license.

=== CODING STANDARDS MADE IN GERMANY ===

The plugin is coded with **modern PHP** and **WordPress standards** in mind. It’s fully OOP coded. It’s highly extendable for developers through several actions and filter hooks.

Passster keeps your website performance in mind. Every script is **loaded conditionally** and all input and output data is secured.


=== MULTI-LANGUAGE ===

All major texts and information can be modified from the admin area of Passster.

The plugin is **fully translatable** in your language. At the moment there are only en_EN and de_DE, but you can easily add your preferred language as a .po/.mo.

It’s also fully compatible with WPML and Polylang.
